In this investigation, a Dopplerized, horizontally polarized, nautical radar is utilized for the monitoring of the wavefield evolution in the littoral zone. The radar datasets are globally unique and cover different geophysical conditions; therefore the impact of the bathymetry on the Doppler spectra is discussed, the horizontal velocity towards the shore is calculated and the properties of the radar deduced quantities are compared with in situ measurements.},
