### **Transforming Operational Earth Sciences**

#### Early Exploration: Academia and Research

My journey began with a deep dive into the fundamentals. I earned my Ph.D. in Physical Oceanography from the University of Hamburg, where I explored the complexities of wave propagation and coastal processes. This foundation led me to research positions at renowned institutions like the Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht and the Naval Research Laboratory, where I developed innovative algorithms for ocean monitoring and data assimilation.

**Revolutionizing Climate Modeling**: Even in my early research, I was driven to push the boundaries of climate science. I led the development of a cloud-based data assimilation platform that enabled more accurate climate projections and improved our understanding of extreme weather events. This platform, built using cutting-edge cloud technologies like AWS and serverless computing, significantly enhanced the scalability and efficiency of climate research.

My research has been published in numerous (XX#) journals and presented at 20+ international conferences, contributing to a deeper understanding of our planet’s dynamic systems.

#### Riding the Wave of Innovation: Start-ups
#### Leading the Charge in Weather and Climate Innovation: Start-ups

Driven by a passion for applying science to real-world challenges, I joined the vibrant world of start-ups. At Tomorrow.io, I led the development of a cutting-edge weather and climate forecasting suite, empowering businesses and individuals with accurate and actionable weather intelligence.

To address the increasing challenges of climate change, I joined Tomorrow.io to lead the development of their cutting-edge weather and climate forecasting platform.  My vision was to empower businesses and individuals with the accurate, actionable weather intelligence they need to make informed decisions and build a more resilient future.

At Tomorrow.io, I spearheaded the development and implementation of AI-powered nowcasting systems for…that increased warning time by X% amount and reduced false alarms. This enhanced public safety and improved the operational efficiency of various industries.
Driving Business Value: I also focused on generating financial growth and securing research funding through successful leadership and strategic vision. 
Building High-Performing Teams: I have consistently built and led multidisciplinary teams of 20-40 scientists, engineers, and technicians, fostering a culture of collaboration, innovation, and high performance in both research and operational settings.

We assembled a world-class team and launched over 90 innovative products, from hyperlocal forecasts to AI-powered nowcasting, and even sent two satellites into orbit to gather critical weather data.

#### Scaling Impact: Large Enterprises

My journey also led me to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), where I played a key role in modernizing America's weather forecasting infrastructure.

Leading Transformational Change: I spearheaded the modernization of weather forecasting infrastructure at NOAA, including the transition to a cloud-based system that improved scalability, reduced operational costs by 15%, and increased system reliability.
Championing Human-Centered Design: I also focused on developing user-friendly weather forecasting tools and communication strategies. This included creating a mobile app that provides personalized weather alerts and risk information to vulnerable populations, resulting in a [quantify improvement] in user satisfaction and decision-making.

I led the transition to cloud-based systems, spearheaded the development of the Unified Forecast System, and championed data assimilation techniques to improve forecast accuracy.  My work at NOAA enhanced public safety, improved efficiency, and strengthened the nation's resilience to weather and climate hazards.

Looking Ahead
I'm excited to continue my journey at the forefront of weather and climate innovation. Whether developing cutting-edge technologies, leading transformational change, or mentoring future leaders, I'm committed to building a more sustainable and resilient future for all.
