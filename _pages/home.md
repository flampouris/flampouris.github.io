####  Transforming Weather and Climate Solutions for a Sustainable Future

<br/>
For over 20 years, I've been on a mission to decode the complex dance between our atmosphere, oceans, and land. As an operational earth scientist, I use cutting-edge tools to analyze and predict these interactions, helping us develop better observation and forecasting systems.

My journey began in Greece, , where I was captivated by the world of marine sciences and numerical and ML modeling from the University of the Aegean. This fascination led me to pursue my MSc and PhD at the University of Kiel and the University of Hamburg, respectively, where I focused on the crucial air-sea interface. 

Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of contributing to groundbreaking research and operational systems at leading institutions like the Hereon Institute, the Naval Research Lab, and NOAA, where I've served across various line offices, including NWS, NOS, and OAR. I've also gained valuable experience in the private sector, holding leadership roles at Tomorrow.io, IMSG, and STC.

As global citizen and scientist, one of my driving forces is the desire to make scientific knowledge accessible to everyone. I'm a firm believer in open science and data, and I actively support initiatives that break down barriers between academia, government, and industry, with the public private partnerships to be the path forward.  

And when the work is done, my happy place is building magnatiles with my toddler and firing up the grill.
